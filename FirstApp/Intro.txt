Web Terminology:

Static Website : server(set of pages (preloaded)) -> client

Dynamic Website : server -> database(s) -> client

Servlet API : package -> javax.servlet
Interfaces: Servlet, ServletRequest, ServletResponse, etc.


Methods of Servlet Interface: 

> init				-> Initialize the servlet.
> service			-> provides reponse for the incoming request.
> destroy			-> invoked only once and to indicate that the servlet is being destroyed.
> getservletconfig	-> returns the object of servletconfig.
> getservletinfo	-> returns information about servlet such as writer, copywrite, version, etc.

1. Servlet class is loaded.
2. Servlet instance is created.
3. Init method invoked. (servlet initialize)
4. Service method invoked. (servlet run)
5. Destroy method invoked. (servlet objects will be destroyed)
